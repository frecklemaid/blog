This month I'll be travelling to Israel, Egypt and Greece before jetting off to Thailand at the end of the month. This means that I may not have a ton of time for reading depending on how long I'll be out each day and able to stand the sweltering heat. However, I am currently in the middle of a few books. My general goals with reading this year centred around language learning - namely Spanish and French. As such, amongst the following books I've got two in English, one in French, one in Spanish and an English-Spanish textbook.  

## L'Ã‚ge des low tech: Vers une civilisation techniquement soutenable by Phillipe Bihouix 
A non-fiction in the 'Anthropocene' series, The Age of Low Tech explores ideas of degrowth and deglobalisation, positing that climate change and other negative environmental effects of human activity can only be tackled by a conscious de-technologisation. I'm currently chipping away at this in [French](https://www.fnac.com/a15606244/Philippe-Bihouix-L-Age-des-low-tech-postface-inedite), but it can also be found with in English [here](https://www.ebooks.com/en-gb/book/210130722/the-age-of-low-tech/philippe-bihouix/).

## [Berlin Stories by Robert Walser](http://specual.me/posts/cr23-06-03/)
A delightful and short [collection](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10729216-berlin-stories?ref=nav_sb_ss_5_14) of snippets, stories and essays by Swiss writer Robert Walser. I started this on the recommendation of [Better Than Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lZifLu0g7k), whose review will inevitably be better than anything I come up with. I haven't read much yet, but the stories that I have - 'Good Morning, Giantess!', 'The Park' and 'Friedrichstrasse' - are absolutely wonderful. Walser's joy for the metropolis truely comes through, and anyone who has loved a metropolis will inevitably relate. Full review [here.](http://specual.me/posts/cr23-06-03/)

## El dador de recuerdos (The Giver) by Lois Lowry 
My most reread book ever, this time I will be reading ['The Giver'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3636.The_Giver) in Spanish. A middle grade dystopian classic, The Giver tells the story of Jonas as he slowly becomes more aware and critical of the compromises made by his community to achieve perfection and conformity. If you haven't read this before, now is the time. 

## Spanish for Reading 
A little antiquated, this [1997 textbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/692095.Spanish_for_Reading) is the main way I'm formally practing Spanish at the moment. Each chapter covers different grammatical aspects of Spanish by incrementally presenting a text that the student reads in whole at the end. So far I'm about a third of the way through and it has really supplemented my immersion. 

## The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler-Colonial Conquest and Resistance, 1917-2017
While I haven't quite started this yet, I'm looking to read ['The Hundred Years' War on Palestine'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41812831-the-hundred-years-war-on-palestine) to further my education about the Israeli-Palestine conflict to provide some added context to my visit to Israel. I'm not necessarily set on this selection so if you have a reccommendation write below!
