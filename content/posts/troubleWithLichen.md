'Trouble with Lichen' isn't John Wyndham's only foray into the wild possibilities of plants. More famously, the Triffids in 'The Day of the Triffids' are carnivorous, mobile plants whose oil has wonderous applicaitons. The titular Lichen of Wyndham's 1960 novel instead has the ability to extend human life. unlike the triffids, the discovery of the 'antigerone' properties of the lichen are kept mum for a long time, and its supply heavily limited. As such, the impact and issues surrounding the lichen are decidedly different. 

## Feminism? 
Previously, I had put John Wyndham in the bucket of older writers that weren't too bad to the modern reader but were identifiably antiquated. However, I think most would appreciate 'Trouble with Lichen' to be an exceedingly modern interpretation of most sex-related issues. One of the two scientists to discover the anti-aging lichen, and the real main character of the book, is a woman who has little urgency or gainful movement towards a life of love in children. She spends much of the book actively criticising the fate of women in her society, and decides to weaponise the lichen in the hope of advancing this plight.
