At just 20 years old I have accomplished an overwhelming amount of nothing, so if this blog brightens even one persons day I'd be stoked. In my normal, not-on-the-internet life I frequent my university where I'm studying a double degree in Arts and IT. I spend way too little time doing coursework, so writing random blog posts provides an entertaining way to procrastinate, and given the Coronapocalypse that's going on as I'm writing this it's also providing a useful distraction from the world.

On this blog you'll find reviews of every kind as well as occasional nonsense. I love reading and sharing reviews of perhaps lesser known books and authors, so if you're looking to get acquainted with something new I hope you'll find it here. If you enjoy a post please drop a comment so that I know you exist (it would be a great comfort to know the zombie apocalypse hasn't started without me noticing.)

## Rating System 
| *     | I didn't like it and had several major issues.           |
| **    | Not the worst, but I had at least one major issue.       |
| ***   | It was either nothing special, or had some minor issues. |
| ****  | Very good but there's room for improvement.              |
| ***** | Incredible and I can't stop thinking about it.           |
